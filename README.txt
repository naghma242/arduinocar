This file is an insight into the repository. 
The code file contains the program I used to make my rover move using my phone to control its movements.
I used basic if/else control statements and took help from the official arduino website to make it work. 
To avoid confusion with pin names, I defined them in the beginning of the code.
I used the Arduino Car app available on Google PlayStore. It is unavailable for iOS.
